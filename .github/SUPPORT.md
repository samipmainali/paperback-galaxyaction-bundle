## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question yourself, it is best to search for existing [Q&A discussions][q-a-discussions] that might help you, you can always continue an already existing discussion. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers. In case you didn't find a suitable answer, you can create a Q&A discussion yourself:

1. Open a [Q&A Discussion][new-q-a-discussion].
2. Give it a clear title and make sure to provide all relevant information.

We will then take care of the Q&A discussion as soon as possible.

You may always ask us questions through our [Discord server][discord-server] as well.

## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for an extension or its website. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your report and find related ones.

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

1. Check if the bug is actually related to an extension or its website:
    - Is it an app issue (e.g., crashing when opening the library page)? If so, reach out to the app developer(s) instead ([more info][app-support]).
    - Could the problem be on your end (e.g., a network issue)?
2. Make sure to search the internet to see if users outside of the GitHub Community or [Discord server][discord-server] have discussed the issue.
3. To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same bug you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug in the [issue tracker][issue-tracker-bugs] or [Discord server support channel][discord-server-support-channel]. If there is, add a comment to the existing one instead of opening a new one.
4. Collect the following information about the bug:
    - App version (e.g. v0.9.1).
    - Extension and their version(s) (e.g. MadaraDex 1.1.3).
    - Website its URL(s) (e.g. https://madaradex.org).
    - Detailed description of the bug, including what you expected to actually happen.
    - Steps to reproduce the bug.
    - _(Optional)_ Title and chapters (e.g. One Piece, Chapter 221).
    - _(Optional)_ Video and/or screenshot.

### Submitting a Good Bug Report

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead use the GitHub [Security Advisory section][security-advisory-section] for sensitive bugs, check the [security guidelines][security-guidelines] for more info.

Bug reports are tracked as [GitHub Issues][issue-tracker-bugs] or through the [Discord server support channel][discord-server-support-channel]. To submit a new bug report:

1. Open a Bug Report [issue][new-bug-issue].
2. Fill in the template and provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it is filed:

1. An organization maintainer or contributor will try to reproduce the bug with your provided steps. Bug reports without (clear) reproduction steps will not be addressed until they can be reproduced.
2. If they are able able to reproduce the bug a fix will be left to be [implemented by someone][contributing-guidelines].

You may always make bug reports through the [Discord server support channel][discord-server-support-channel] as well.

## Suggesting Enhancements

This section walks you through submitting enhancement suggestions for extensions, whether it's requesting a brand-new extension, adding features to an existing one, or improving current functionality. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related ones.

### Before Submitting an Enhancement Suggestion

A good enhancement suggestion shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us consider any enhancement suggestion as fast as possible.

1. Find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
2. Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this enhancement. Keep in mind that we want enhancements that will be useful to the majority of the users and not just a small subset.
3. To see if other users have suggested the same enhancement, check if there is not already a feature enhancement related to yours existing in the [issue tracker][issue-tracker-enhancements]. If there is, add a comment to the existing one instead of opening a new one.

### Submitting a Good Enhancement Suggestion

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub Issues][issue-tracker-enhancements] or through the [Discord server support channel][discord-server-support-channel]. To submit a new enhancement suggestion:

1. Open an Enhancement Suggestion [issue][new-enhancement-issue].
2. Fill in the template and make sure to provide all relevant information.

Once it is filed:

1. An organization maintainer or contributor will review your enhancement suggestion and discuss its feasibility and impact on the project.
2. If the enhancement is deemed appropriate and aligns with the project's goals, it will be labeled accordingly and left to be [implemented by someone][contributing-guidelines].

You may always make enhancement suggestions through the [Discord server support channel][discord-server-support-channel] as well.
